  <h2>Core Text Elements</h3>

   <h1><<span>h2</span>><<span>/h2</span>> Heading 1</h1>

   <h2><<span>h2</span>><<span>/h2</span>> Heading 2</h2>

   <h3><<span>h3</span>><<span>/h3</span>> Heading 3</h3>

   <h4><<span>h4</span>><<span>/h4</span>> Heading 4</h4>

   <h5><<span>h5</span>><<span>/h5</span>> Heading 5</h5>

   <h6><<span>h6</span>><<span>/h6</span>> Heading 6</h6>

   <p><<span>p</span>><<span>/p</span>> The paragraph tags have been used at the beginning and the end of this paragraph and each following paragraph in this section. This applies a default non-heading font size and generally ensures at least two line breaks at the beginning and end of the paragraph without creating additional breaks where they aren't necessary due to adjacent paragraph or heading tags.</p>

   <p></p><<span>br</span>> Break<br>
   tags have been used after the first word of this sentence and before the
   <br>last.</p>
  
   <p><<span>span</span>><<span>/span</span>> Span tags have been used between the brackets and the rest of the tag in the tags that are visible on the webpage in order to render them as text rather than being computed by the browser as tags.</p>

   <p></p><<span>ul</span>><<span>/ul</span>> Unordered list tags have been used in the All Elements section below to present the links as an unordered list.</p>

   <p><<span>a</span>><<span>/a</span>> or <<span>a href=""</span>><<span>/a</span>> Anchor tags have been used in the All Elements section below to add hyperlinks to the URL text. The <<span>a href=""</span>><<span>/a</span>> tag is used to turn any text into a hyperlink and underline it, while the <<span>a</span>><<span>/a</span>> tag by itself will turn the URL itself into a hyperlink with no underline.</p>
